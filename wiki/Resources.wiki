== Autoboxing ==

Autoboxing is available as of Java 1.5.0 and introduces the automated handling of primitive Java type to their equivalent Wrapper class. [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html Java 1.5.0 Language Guilde]

== Imports & Performace ==

Did some research and it seems that conventional wisdom suggests that using imports with the wild card character, of the form:
{{{
import javax.swing.*;
}}}
does not impact runtime performance. There is however a valid case for specifying exactly the classes you wish to import as detailed in [http://www.javafaq.nu/java-article914.html this article].

== SAX & DOM ==

SAX - Event Driven, stack based parsing, akin to shift-reduce mechanism employed by bottom-up parsers. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML Wikipedia]

DOM - Tree Walking [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model Wikipedia]
