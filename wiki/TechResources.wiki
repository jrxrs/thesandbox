= Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) =

What is a DMZ? This description is from the Tullett's documentation of their *Post:market* Service, Gateway and API, it does a nice job of explaining what a DMZ is and why you might want to use one:

   There are instances where a client does not wish the in-house application using the Post:marker Java or C# API to directly access the Internet.  In these cases the Post:marker Gateway can be placed in a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) which does have access to the Internet.  The Post:marker Java API then communicates remotely with the Post:marker Gateway.  The in-house application therefore only needs access to the DMZ and not the wider network. This configuration is shown below:
