= Caching =

 * [http://ehcache.org/ Ehcache]
 * !GemFire Cache
!GemFire is a Java based cache  tutorial [http://community.gemstone.com/display/gemfire/GemFire+Tutorial here]. !GemFire is a distributed cache in which each distributed peer is connected to all other peers. A more comprehensive overview can be found [http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449323950/id2325011_09-gemfire.html here]. Under the !GemFire Client/Server architecture each !GemFire peer becomes a server which also listens to connections from !GemFire clients on a separate port. A !GemFire client only connects to a limited number of these cache servers (which it discovers via a locator) but because all the !GemFire peers/servers are linked to each other the client has access to the entire data grid.

= XA =

*Note:* The whole point of XA is that transactions are global (as opposed to local) which means you can tie actions/events together to make everything atomic. So essentially _global_ transactions enable you to work with multiple transactional resources (e.g. relational databases and message queues) at the same time. A _local_ transaction on the other hand is resource specific, e.g. just a JMS broker or a database.

The Java Transaction API ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Transaction_API JTA]) is JavaEE's implementation of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open_XA XA] standard protocol. JTA is part of the JavaEE specification, which means that any JavaEE-compliant application server must provide JTA support (some lightweight alternatives like Apache Tomcat do not provide it). Using JTA outside a JAVA EE server takes some work to set up because you have to find and use a JTA transaction manager, such as one of these:
