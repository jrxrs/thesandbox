 > DIAGNOSIS: Variable 'fooVariable' was not found in the current scope,
 > however it does exist in a different scope within Matching.c. Unfortunately
 > that scope is not visibile to the scope including line 11 (the current scope
 > - which began on line 10). The occurance(s) of 'fooVariable' and the line
 > number of the scope appear below.
 >   Variable Name                               Exists in Scope visible from:
 >   fooVariable                                 Line 4 to 7
 > If you would like to use one of the versions of 'fooVariable' listed above
 > on line 11 you could move fooVariable's declaration to line 3 (giving it
 > global scope), or alternatively if you want to declare a distinct variable
 > called 'fooVariable' to use on line 11 then declare it at the beginning of
 > the current scope which starts on line 10.
