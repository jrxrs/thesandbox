# Dockers

## Commands

```bash
docker pull <image_name>
```
Pull an image down from the container registry.

```bash
docker images
```
List all of your local images.

```bash
docker build --tag <tag_name>
```
Build a docker image from a Dockerfile and annotate it with the specified tag name.

```bash
docker history <tag_name>
```
Show what happened to your image while it was being built (including information about the size of the image at each layer/stage).

```bash
docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash
```
This runs a container and attaches to stdin, /bin/bash is the processed which is opened and ```-it``` is the interactive flag.

```bash
docker ps
```
Lists the currently running containers. Add ```-a``` to list containers which have been stopped.

```bash
docker start <container_identifier>
```
If you wanted to start one of the stopped containers list above then use the command above.

```bash
docker attach <container_identifier>
```
The ```start``` command will restart your container but it will not attach to it automatically like ```run -it``` did, so use ```attach``` instead.

```bash
docker stop <container_identifier>
```
Stop a running container.

```bash
docker rm <container_identifier>
```
Clean up any stopped containers by removing them.

```bash
docker container prune -f
```
Purge all the containers you've previously deleted.

```bash
docker rmi <image_name>
```
Delete a docker image that you've built locally or pulled from a container registry.

```bash
docker image prune -af
```
Purge all docker images that you've previously deleted.
